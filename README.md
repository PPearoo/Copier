# Copier
A bot that lets you copy things, just like how you can copy channels in Discord.

## Usage
1. Create a bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Invite the bot to your server. It needs the `bot` scope and either `Manage Channels` or `Administrator` permission. `Manage Channels` will not allow the bot to see channels it doesn't have access to, so `Administrator` is recommended.
3. Reset and copy the bot's token.
4. Clone the repository.
5. Replace `<token-here>` with the bot's token in the `.env` file.
6. Install prerequisites with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
7. Run the bot with `python3 bot.py`.

The code is under The Unlicense license, feel free to do anything you want with it.
